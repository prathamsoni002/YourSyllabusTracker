# YourSyllabusTracker
YourSyllabusTracker is an android application developed with Android Studios using the Java language. 
This project aims to help the students to track their Syllabus over the application by checking the boxes in front of the specific topic under the appropriate chapters of the relevant subject.
This also provides the students with general deadlines to complete the topics over the specific week of the year and when a new chapter should start and when to end.
The real-life application is not only supposed to end with the students but also help the Coaching classes or Colleges to have a check over the activities of the students and to understand 
which student has completed the topics and which gives them problems.
